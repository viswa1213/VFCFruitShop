Place the provided logo image here as `vfc_logo.png`.

Steps:
1. Save the attached PNG image (the VFC circular logo) to this path:
   Frontend/assets/images/vfc_logo.png

2. The splash page will automatically use this asset. If the file is missing the app will fall back to the FlutterLogo.

3. If you add the file while the app is running, restart the app (flutter run) to pick up the new asset.

Notes:
- `pubspec.yaml` already includes `assets/images/` so no change there is necessary.
- If you want multiple resolution variants, add files like `vfc_logo@2x.png` and `vfc_logo@3x.png` alongside the base file.
